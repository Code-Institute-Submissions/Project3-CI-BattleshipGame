<i> <b> "Code Institute Project #3" </b> </i> - <h2> Battleship Game </h2>

<p> This is my third project for Code Institute based on my knowledge of Python  </p>
<p> This is a project that runs in the Code Institute's mock terminal on Heroku </p>

<h2> Basic Gameplay </h2>
<h3> Battleships is a game based on the classic pen-and-paper game, players input their name and two boards are randomly created. The player can see the location of their own ships, represented by an "$" symbol, but cannot view the computer's ships. Guesses are marked on the board with an "*" and successful hits are indicated by "@".
Players take turns making guesses to sink each other's battleships. The objective is to be the first player to sink all of their opponent's battleships. </h3>


<h2> Features </h2>
<ul> 
  <li> <h3> Users get to choose the coordinates for their ships and the board for the computer is created randomly </h3> </li>

 <li> <h3> Input Validation to make sure same coordinates are not repeated.
  Also the inputs can only be within the set range </h3> </li>

<h2> Bugs </h2>
<h3> Solved Bugs: </h3>
  <p> In the first version of this app, the user could input same coordinates over and over again. A new verification was written to avoid user from repeating the same coordinates </p>
 
<h2> Deployment </h2>
<h3> This app was deployed using Code Institute's mock terminal on Heroku </h3>
